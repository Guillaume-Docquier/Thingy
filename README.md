# Thingy - STS Independent project  
Thingy is a web app that allows users to rent tools or common goods (We call them Thingies) from anyone. You have a set of speakers you don't use often? Write a little description, add some pictures, set a price and you're good to go! You need a drill to help your dad fix the stairs? Get on Thingy, search for a drill an apply for a rent! And you'd better behave, because people will check your reviews.
