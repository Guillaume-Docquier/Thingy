				For a long time, online communities, markets for the sale of everyday objects have been going. Everything from cars to electronics and clothing can now be bought and sold through internet. Now, however, we face a new reality where the environment, like the Internet, will play a larger role in our lives. It is both expensive and harmful for the environment to buy new things all the time. Imagine you need to use an expensive tool, such as a floor grinding or projector just once, which means that it is both uneconomical and environmentally unfriendly as the machine later will just stand and gather dust. The solution to this is Thingy. Thingy is an application that will connect people in order for them to rent things from each other. Thingy will serve as a meeting place where you can advertise and find people who are willing to rent things you might just have standing at home. Similar, of course, people who are looking for special things can add an ad to find this. So for example if you are having a party, you can post an ad for speakers, chairs and tables and for a limited time you can rent this from a private person that might be living just around the corner.
